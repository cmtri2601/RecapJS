/**
 * A transform stream is the more interesting duplex stream because 
 * its output is computed from its input.
 * 
 * For a transform stream, we donâ€™t have to implement the read or 
 * write methods, we only need to implement a transform method, 
 * which combines both of them. It has the signature of the write 
 * method and we can use it to push data as well.
